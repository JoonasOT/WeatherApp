# Contents

This is my implementation for the WeatherApp project. This project mainly
consists of WeatherApp.java, backend content and frontend content.

## WeatherApp.java

This is the main file for the whole WeatherApp project.

**Before running this make sure you have saved an API key for the program!**
To make an API key for OpenWeather follow the instructions found from
[/Documents/README.md](../../../../../../../Documents/README.md). The program
used for encrypting can be found from the directory: [../keygen/](../keygen/).

## Frontend

The frontend directory contains all the frontend code used by the WeatherApp.
The contents of the directory DO NOT create any new windows, but contains scenes
etc. that then switch onto the stage created at WeatherApp.java. 

## Backend

The backend directory contains the application backend and all it's prerequisites.
The main backend is located at [Backend singleton](./backend/Backend.java).
